# Portfolio Website
this is a portfolio website to showcase some stuff and who i am, the overall structure was created  by Takuya Matsuyama(craftzdog on github).
He created a youtube video detailing how he created the website and I coded along, but it has to be said that its just a copy and paste kind of job, so its besically a theme provided by him.
In due time I will create my own porfolio website from scratch, maybe with chakra UI, because I really like how its component system work.
